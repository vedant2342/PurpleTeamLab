# 🟣 Purple Team Detection Lab  
**End-to-End Detection Engineering & Alerting Framework**

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **end-to-end detection engineering pipeline** that simulates real-world cyber attacks, validates detection logic, classifies threat severity, and generates security alerts in a Purple Team lab environment.

It models a real enterprise security lifecycle:
> Attack → Detection → Validation → Alerting → Severity → Learning → Improvement

This is not just scripting — it is a **security engineering system design**.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Build a realistic detection engineering workflow
- Simulate attacker behavior (Red Team)
- Validate detection logic (Blue Team)
- Create feedback loops (Purple Team)
- Generate intelligent alerts
- Classify threats by severity
- Automate detection validation using CI/CD
